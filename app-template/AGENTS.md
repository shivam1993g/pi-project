# Generated application contract

- Keep the application self-contained and runnable with `npm run dev` at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Store durable single-user browser data locally when persistence is required.
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible names so browser automation can use the interface without brittle selectors.
- Add tests for the product's critical user journeys and run them before claiming success.
- The seed intentionally contains no product tests. Add at least one completed, passing `src/**/*.test.ts` or `src/**/*.test.tsx` test; the runner rejects zero-test reports and any skipped or todo tests.
- Use only the dependencies already installed from the committed lockfile. Do not add packages or run dependency-install commands.
- `report.partial.json` contains only `status`, `app_url`, `start_command`, `summary`, `implemented_features`, `assumptions`, and `tests_run`.
- A `success` report must contain at least one `tests_run` entry and every entry must be `passed`. If a journey failed or was not run, record it as `failed`, explain why in `journey`, and use `partial` (or `failed` when the app cannot run).
- The runner owns the final `app_url`, location-aware `start_command`, independent `harness_checks`, and telemetry fields. Your product-journey test records remain in the specification-defined `tests_run` field.
- Do not create or edit `result.json`; the outer challenge runner derives its telemetry from Pi.
